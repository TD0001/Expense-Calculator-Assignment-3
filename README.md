0 Introduction
It is my first little project since I began learning iOS development. After about one month's learning, finally I created an iOS app with integral functions. Certainly, currently the app is still very simple, but I will add more functions for it later.

1 Function
 Add a record
 Delete a record
 Display the detail of a record
 
2 Feature
 Based on MVC(Massive View Controller?)
 Core Data used
 Support Dark Mode
 Simple User Interface
